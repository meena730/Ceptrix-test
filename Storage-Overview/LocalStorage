Local Storage is a small space inside your browser where websites can store information about you — and that data stays saved, even after you close the tab or shut down your computer.

📝 Why is it useful?
Because it helps websites:

Remember you even after refreshing or closing the browser

Save your choices (like language or theme)

Store temporary data (like form inputs, tokens, or login info)

🧪 Simple Example:
Let’s say a website wants to remember your name:

localStorage.setItem('name', 'Meena');                           // Save the name
Later, it can get your name like this:

const name = localStorage.getItem('name');                                  // Get the name
console.log(name); // → Meena
And to delete it:

localStorage.removeItem('name');
📌 Things to Know:
Local Storage saves data in your browser only

It doesn’t get deleted automatically (until you delete it)

It only stores text (not numbers, objects, or images directly)

It’s useful for small data (limit is around 5MB)

📦 Real-life Example:
You're shopping online, and you close the tab.
Next time you open it — your cart is still there.
That’s because the website used localStorage to remember your cart items.
